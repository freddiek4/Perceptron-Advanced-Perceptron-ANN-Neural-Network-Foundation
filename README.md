This project covers the implementation of two machine learning models from scratch: 1. Perceptron: A simple linear classifier. 2. Artificial Neural Network (ANN): A multi-layer perceptron model for classifying dry beans using a real-world dataset. Each part of the project demonstrates the basic principles of machine learning: training a model to learn patterns from data and making predictions on new data.

Part 1: Perceptron from Scratch

What is a Perceptron? A Perceptron is the simplest form of a neural network. It is a linear classifier that tries to find a straight line (or hyperplane) to separate two classes. The model adjusts its weights through a learning process until it can correctly classify the input data.

How It Works: 1. Inputs and Weights: The perceptron takes inputs (features) and multiplies them by weights. 2. Activation: It sums the results and applies a threshold to decide if the output is class 1 or -1. 3. Learning: The model updates its weights whenever it makes a wrong prediction, pushing the decision boundary to better separate the two classes.

Usage: The Perceptron model is implemented from scratch and trained on a synthetic dataset with two features. The accuracy of the model is evaluated on a test set, and its decision boundary is visualized using a scatter plot.

Part 2: Artificial Neural Network for Dry Beans Classification

What is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)? An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a more complex version of a perceptron. It contains multiple layers of neurons and is capable of learning non-linear patterns. ANNs are used for various tasks, such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition. In this project, we use an ANN to classify seven different types of dry beans based on 16 attributes related to size and shape.

How It Works: 1. Input Layer: Receives the 16 features of each bean. 2. Hidden Layers: Two hidden layers process the inputs and extract complex patterns. 3. Output Layer: Produces the final classification of the bean type (e.g., Seker, Barbunya, etc.). 4. Training: The model learns by adjusting its weights using a process called backpropagation, minimizing the error between the predicted and actual outputs. 5. Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated using accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), precision, and recall.

Usage: The Dry Beans Dataset is used, which contains 13,611 instances of seven different bean types. A feed-forward neural network is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The networkâ€™s performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and other metrics.
